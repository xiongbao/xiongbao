UX Designer / Front-end / Fuckstack / Origin-Design Purist

I'm currently at Tencent Cloud, making [CNB](https://cnb.cool/) (Cloud Native Build) look like it was designed by humans, for humans.

- I build things that nobody asked for.
- I provide output that has zero market value.
- I obsess over original designs until they are no longer original.

I know a bit of everything, which is a fancy way of saying I’m dangerous in any codebase.

Currently: Refining UX @ CNB, Tencent Cloud.
